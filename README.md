# UFOs
This project is less about analysis and more about visualizing the information on a webpage, allowing viewers to see the data and filter it on their own, based on the criteria they want.

## Resources
- Data: Data.js contains information on UFO sigtings.
- Software: 
    - HTML
    - Javascript
    - Javascript library: D3  (https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js)


## Functionality
 - Using the website available in this repository, search for UFO sightings that were documented the first two weeks of 2010 in North America. You can search the table by date, city, state, country, and shape of the sightings.
- When entering your search criteria, please use all lowercase letters and ensure your date format is M/D/YYYY. Note that the date range available in this table is 1/1/2010-1/13/2010, so you will not see results for dates outside of that range.

##Future improvments:
- count of search results.
- change the way search happens:
    - current search: you type in what you are looking for and recieve exact matches only.
    - upgrade: the unique options contained within the table are autopoulated and available for selection.
- able to filter the comments, partial matches (or "contained within") are required to do this.
- able to exclude criteria in the filter.
